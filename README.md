# Traffic-Sign-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles

Traffic sign detection and recognition plays an important role in expert systems, such as traffic assistance driving systems and automatic driving systems. It instantly assists drivers or automatic driving systems in detecting and recognizing traffic signs effectively.
• In our data set, there are 43 different classes for Traffic signals.
• Our dataset is smaller but complex.
• Therefore, preprocessing of the images is crucial for us to succeed in this task.
• We will import data from an external source, and then we will process the data to train a neural network.
• Preprocessing and preparing dataset are extremely important in the field of Deep Learning.
• The dataset is smaller containing fewer images in the training set and validation set and the test set. Also, the dataset contains many classes (total 43), in where the traffic signs can be classified. This means not only our dataset is smaller, but also, we have fewer images belonging to each class since the dataset is being classified into many classes and the dataset is complex. This makes it difficult for our network to learn properly for the high accuracy rates.

IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY:
1. Collecting data from repository
2. Data distribution of training dataset
3. Preprocessing data
4. leNet model implementation
5. Image Augmentation
6. Classifying traffic signs from internet to evaluete model performance.

Final Outcomes:
• Our model successfully classified traffic signs from the internet.
•	Modified leNet model and achieved training accuracy of 99.12% and validation accuracy of 98.09%.
